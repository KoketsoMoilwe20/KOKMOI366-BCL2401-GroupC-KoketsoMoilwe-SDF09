 CSS Frameworks (Tailwind)

 Overview: I was provided with a starter code that includes essential HTML elements. My task was to apply Tailwind CSS classes to these elements to achieve a responsive design that aligns with modern web development practices.

Reflections

Areas of Mastery
CSS Layout Techniques: Successfully used flexbox using Tailwind to the elements.
Responsive Design: I added input elements, buttons and links for user-experience.
Styling Elements: I feel confident enough to style elements. 

Challenges Faced
Responsive Design for Smaller Screens: Adjusting the layouts for a smaller screen size was a bit challenging. But when watching a few tutorials and some lessons on Scrimba i was able to adjust my layouts.
Hover and Focus Effects: I was confidents applying these effects and styling them in different colors.

Areas for Improvement
Advanced CSS Properties: Media Queries, adjusting layouts for a smaller screen.
Code Optimization: I'm trying to use short code now, as it is better code. I would like to improve on that.
Creative Design Choices: I would like to learn more and experiment more with my creativity.
